	<h1>About me</h1>

	<h2>Kind words</h2>

	<blockquote><p><span class="open">“</span>Stephan is a superb Flash and Flex developer. Working independently from France with the team based mostly in NYC and San Francisco, Stephan has helped us build our first several iterations of our embeddable Flash player, which has allowed us to move our internet radio listening to Facebook, blogs and other third‐party platforms. In addition, Stephan was integral in setting up our Flash playback using HTML controls on the flagship website, taking advantage of an external application called SoundManager.</p>
	<p>Stephan is dependable and talented, and I'd strongly recommend him.<span class="close">”</span></p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p><span class="open">“</span>I had the pleasure of working with Stephan on a project over the Christmas holidays here in LA. At times, we had team members in LA, Shanghai, New York & Paris, but Stephan was always on top of his game and available almost round the clock. Our deadline was near impossible, but with Mr. Florquin on the job, we delivered an amazing product. I will continue to champion this developer's skills for the rest of my days online.<span class="close">”</span></p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><p><span class="open">“</span>Stephan is a highly talented and versatile developer. He is able to interpret designs and implement complex functionality, while adding a creative flair to create usable, beautiful products. Also, Stephan is wonderful to work with, pays attention to details and makes tight deadlines.<span class="close">”</span></p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p><span class="open">“</span>Stephan Florquin travaille très proprement, possède une excellente sensibilité visuelle et un sens de l'ergonomie, lui permettant d'anticiper la demande du graphiste. Il aurait pu faire une excellente carrière en indépendant, quel dommage qu'il décide de se sédentariser.<span class="close">”</span></p></blockquote>
